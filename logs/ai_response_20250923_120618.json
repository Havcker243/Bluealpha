  "response": "**Answer:**\nThe top three channels by contribution to revenue in Q2 were Facebook Ads (33%), Google Ads (27%), and YouTube (18%).\n\n**Explanation:**\nThese three channels were the primary drivers of revenue, collectively accounting for 78% of the total marketing contribution. Their high contribution is a direct result of having the largest budgets and strong efficiency.\n\n*   **Facebook Ads** was the top contributor at 33%, driven by the highest spend of $110,000 and an excellent Return on Investment (ROI) of 1.45.\n*   **Google Ads** followed with a 27% contribution, backed by a significant spend of $90,000 and a solid ROI of 1.39.\n*   **YouTube** secured the third spot with an 18% contribution, spending $50,000 and delivering a strong ROI of 1.40.\n\nWhile these channels are your strongest performers, they are also reaching saturation, meaning there is less opportunity for growth from additional spending. Their marginal ROI (the return on the *next* dollar spent) is quite low (Facebook: 0.017, Google: 0.018, YouTube: 0.014), indicating diminishing returns at their current investment levels.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1.  **Maintain Baseline Spend:** Continue investing in Facebook Ads, Google Ads, and YouTube at current levels to protect their significant revenue contributions.\n2.  **Test Incremental Budget on TikTok:** For any new or reallocated budget, consider testing an increase in TikTok. It currently has the highest marginal ROI (0.019), suggesting it has the most room to efficiently absorb more spending and generate stronger returns on the next dollar.\n\n**Guardrails:**\nThis analysis is based on the following observed weekly spend ranges in Q2:\n*   **Facebook Ads:** $70,000 - $150,000\n*   **Google Ads:** $60,000 - $120,000\n*   **YouTube:** $30,000 - $90,000\n\n**Source:**\nModel Version: meridian_2025_09_20\nData Period: 2025-Q2\n\n**Confidence:**\nHigh (Model RÂ²: 0.84, MAPE: 0.13)",
