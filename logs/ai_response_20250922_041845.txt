**Answer**
Based on the data, you should first reallocate your budget among your existing channels to improve efficiency before considering adding new ones.

**Explanation**
Your current media mix shows a clear opportunity to improve overall performance by shifting funds from less effective to more effective channels. The key metric for this decision is the marginal ROI (mROI), which tells you the return you get for every *additional* dollar spent. Several of your channels are showing very low marginal returns, while others have significant room for growth.

*   **Highest Potential:** **TikTok** is your most promising channel for additional investment. It has the highest marginal ROI (**mROI of 0.019**) and a moderate saturation level (65%), meaning it can effectively absorb more budget. For every extra dollar you spend here, you are projected to get more back than from any other channel.
*   **Strong Performers:** **Google Ads (mROI 0.018)** and **Facebook Ads (mROI 0.017)** are also highly efficient at the margin. However, they are more saturated (78% and 80%, respectively), indicating they are closer to the point of diminishing returns.
*   **Underperformers:** **Pinterest (mROI 0.009)**, **Snapchat (mROI 0.010)**, **Twitter Ads (mROI 0.011)**, and **LinkedIn (mROI 0.012)** are delivering the lowest returns on your next dollar. Continuing to invest at current levels in these channels is inefficient compared to your other options.

Instead of adding the complexity of new channels, optimizing your current eight will yield better and more immediate results.

**Recommendations**
1.  **Reduce Spend on Underperformers:** Consider decreasing the budget for Pinterest, Snapchat, Twitter Ads, and LinkedIn, as they have the lowest marginal ROI.
2.  **Reallocate to Top Performer:** Shift the freed-up budget primarily to **TikTok** to capitalize on its high mROI of 0.019.
3.  **Scale Strong Performers Carefully:** You can also allocate a portion of the budget to **Google Ads** and **Facebook Ads**, but be mindful that they are already heavily saturated and returns will diminish more quickly.

**Guardrails**
This analysis is based on the observed weekly spend ranges in the model. Any spending decisions outside these ranges will have less predictable outcomes.
*   **TikTok:** $20,000 - $70,000
*   **Google Ads:** $60,000 - $120,000
*   **Facebook Ads:** $70,000 - $150,000
*   **LinkedIn:** $15,000 - $60,000
*   **Snapchat:** $10,000 - $50,000
*   **Twitter Ads:** $20,000 - $60,000
*   **Pinterest:** $10,000 - $40,000
