  "response": "**Answer:**\nThe top three channels by contribution to revenue in Q2 were Facebook Ads (33%), Google Ads (27%), and YouTube (18%).\n\n**Explanation:**\nThese three channels were the primary drivers of revenue, collectively accounting for 78% of the total marketing contribution. Their high contribution is a direct result of their significant investment levels, as they also received the largest budgets during this period. While all three showed strong overall efficiency, a closer look at their performance reveals key differences:\n\n*   **Facebook Ads:** Was the top contributor at 33% with the highest spend of $110,000. It also delivered the best overall efficiency with a Return on Investment (ROI) of 1.45.\n*   **Google Ads:** The second-largest contributor at 27% on a $90,000 spend. It maintained a strong ROI of 1.39 and showed the most potential for efficient growth among the top three.\n*   **YouTube:** Contributed 18% from a $50,000 spend. Although its ROI of 1.40 is high, it is showing signs of saturation, meaning additional investment may not be as effective.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1.  **Maintain Investment in Top Performers:** Continue funding Facebook Ads and Google Ads, as they are the foundational pillars of your revenue generation.\n2.  **Optimize for Future Growth:** Consider reallocating a portion of the YouTube budget to TikTok. YouTube’s marginal ROI (mROI) is the lowest of the top three at 0.014, while TikTok's is the highest of all channels at 0.019. This means for every additional dollar moved from YouTube to TikTok, you could generate a higher return.\n\n**Guardrails:**\nThis analysis is based on the observed quarterly spend ranges for the following channels:\n*   **Facebook Ads:** between $70,000 and $150,000.\n*   **Google Ads:** between $60,000 and $120,000.\n*   **YouTube:** between $30,000 and $90,000.\n*   **TikTok:** between $20,000 and $70,000.\n\n**Source:**\nModel version meridian_2025_09_20, analyzing the period of 2025-Q2.\n\n**Confidence:**\nHigh (Based on a model R² of 0.84 and a MAPE of 0.13, indicating strong predictive accuracy).",
