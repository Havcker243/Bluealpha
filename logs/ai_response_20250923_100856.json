  "response": "**Answer:** In Q2, the ROI for Google Ads was 1.39, which is slightly less efficient than the 1.45 ROI for Facebook Ads.\n\n**Explanation:**\nWhile Facebook Ads delivered a higher overall return on investment (ROI of 1.45 vs. Google's 1.39), both channels are showing signs of heavy saturation, which limits their potential for growth. Saturation means you are reaching a point of diminishing returns where each additional dollar spent generates less impact. Facebook is currently at 80% saturation, while Google is at 78%.\n\nA key metric for future investment is the marginal ROI (mROI), which tells you the return on your *next* dollar spent.\n*   **Google Ads** has a marginal ROI of **0.018**.\n*   **Facebook Ads** has a marginal ROI of **0.017**.\n\nThis indicates that while Facebook was more efficient historically, the next dollar you spend on Google Ads is expected to be slightly more effective than the next dollar spent on Facebook. Both channels, however, have very low mROIs, suggesting that significant new investment in either may not be efficient.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1.  **Slight Reallocation:** Consider shifting a small portion of the budget (e.g., 5-10%) from Facebook Ads to Google Ads to capitalize on Google's slightly higher marginal ROI.\n2.  **Monitor Saturation:** Since both channels are heavily saturated, avoid significant budget increases. Doing so would likely lead to very inefficient spending with minimal returns.\n3.  **Explore Other Channels:** Look for opportunities in less saturated channels with higher marginal ROIs. For example, TikTok has an mROI of 0.019 at only 65% saturation, making it a better candidate for any incremental budget.\n\n**Guardrails:**\nThis analysis is based on the following observed quarterly spend ranges:\n*   **Google Ads:** Between $60,000 and $120,000.\n*   **Facebook Ads:** Between $70,000 and $150,000.\n\n**Source:**\nModel version meridian_2025_09_20, analyzing data from 2025-Q2.\n\n**Confidence:**\nHigh (The model's RÂ² of 0.84 and MAPE of 0.13 indicate a strong and reliable fit to the historical data).",
