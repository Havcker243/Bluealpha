  "response": "**Answer:**\nIn Q2, the top three channels by contribution to revenue were Facebook Ads (33%), Google Ads (27%), and YouTube (18%).\n\n**Explanation:**\nThese three channels drove the majority of your revenue because they received the highest investment and delivered it efficiently. Their combined 78% contribution is a direct result of their significant budgets and strong performance.\n\n*   **Facebook Ads** was the top contributor at 33%, driven by the largest spend of $110,000 and the highest Return on Investment (ROI) of 1.45.\n*   **Google Ads** followed with a 27% contribution from a $90,000 spend, showing solid efficiency with an ROI of 1.39.\n*   **YouTube** secured the third spot with an 18% contribution, generating an impressive ROI of 1.40 from a $50,000 spend.\n\nWhile these channels are your biggest drivers, they are also showing signs of saturation, meaning the returns from additional spending are diminishing. Their saturation levels are currently 80% for Facebook, 78% for Google, and 72% for YouTube.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1.  **Maintain spend on top performers:** Continue funding Facebook Ads and Google Ads, as they are the primary drivers of revenue.\n2.  **Optimize at the margin:** Consider reallocating a small portion of the YouTube budget to TikTok. While YouTube is a top contributor, its marginal ROI (mROI) is 0.014. In contrast, TikTok has a higher mROI of 0.019, indicating that the next dollar spent there will be more effective at generating revenue.\n\n**Guardrails:**\nThis analysis is based on the following observed quarterly spend ranges:\n*   **Facebook Ads:** $70,000 - $150,000\n*   **Google Ads:** $60,000 - $120,000\n*   **YouTube:** $30,000 - $90,000\n*   **TikTok:** $20,000 - $70,000\n\n**Source:**\nModel version meridian_2025_09_20, analyzing data for 2025-Q2.\n\n**Confidence:**\nHigh (The model's RÂ² of 0.84 and MAPE of 0.13 indicate a strong and reliable fit to the historical data).",
