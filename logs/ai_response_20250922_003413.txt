**Answer:**
You should reallocate your budget among your current channels to improve efficiency rather than adding new ones, as there is a clear opportunity to shift funds from low-return channels to those with higher growth potential.

**Explanation:**
Your current marketing mix has channels at very different stages of efficiency. The key is to look at the **Marginal ROI (mROI)**, which tells you the return you'll get from the *next dollar* you spend. Some of your channels are becoming saturated (where more spending brings diminishing returns), while others still have room to grow.

*   **Top Opportunity:** **TikTok** has the highest mROI at **0.019**. This means for every additional dollar you invest here, you get the best return compared to any other channel. It is also only 65% saturated, indicating it can efficiently absorb more budget.
*   **Saturated Performers:** **Facebook Ads** and **Google Ads** are your largest contributors and have good overall ROI (1.45 and 1.39, respectively). However, they are highly saturated (80% and 78%) with lower mROIs (0.017 and 0.018). Increasing their budgets further would be inefficient.
*   **Underperformers:** **Pinterest**, **Snapchat**, and **Twitter Ads** have the lowest mROIs (**0.009**, **0.010**, and **0.011**). This means the last dollars spent on these channels are generating the least return.

By reallocating budget from the underperformers to your top opportunity (TikTok), you can significantly improve the overall efficiency of your marketing spend without increasing your total budget.

**Recommendations:**
1.  **Increase Investment in TikTok:** Shift budget towards TikTok to capitalize on its high marginal ROI of 0.019. It has the most room for efficient growth.
2.  **Reduce Spend on Bottom-Tier Channels:** Decrease your spending on Pinterest (mROI 0.009), Snapchat (mROI 0.010), and Twitter Ads (mROI 0.011). The funds from these channels can be used to fuel growth in TikTok.
3.  **Maintain Spend on Core Channels:** Keep your budgets for Google Ads and Facebook Ads stable for now. While they are strong contributors, their high saturation means additional investment will not be effective at this time.

**Guardrails:**
This analysis is based on the weekly spend levels observed in the model. Performance may differ outside these ranges:
*   **TikTok:** Weekly spend between $20k and $70k.
*   **Pinterest:** Weekly spend between $10k and $40k.
*   **Snapchat:** Weekly spend between $10k and $50k.
*   **Google Ads:** Weekly spend between $60k and $120k.
*   **Facebook Ads:** Weekly spend between $70k and $150k.
