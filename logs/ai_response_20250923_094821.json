  "response": "**Answer:**\nPinterest has the lowest adstock, meaning the impact of your advertising on this channel fades the fastest.\n\n**Explanation:**\nAdstock measures the carryover effect of your ads—how long their impact lingers after the initial exposure. Pinterest has an adstock decay of 0.44 and a maximum effect duration of 4 weeks. This is the lowest of all your channels, indicating its impact is very short-term. For comparison, TikTok has the highest adstock decay (0.62) and a 9-week duration, meaning its advertising impact is more prolonged. This suggests that while Pinterest might be useful for immediate, in-the-moment conversions, it is less effective at building lasting brand recall. Compounding this issue, Pinterest also has the lowest overall ROI at 1.1 and a very low marginal ROI (mROI) of 0.009, indicating that additional investment is currently inefficient.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1.  **Adapt Your Strategy for Pinterest:** Since you cannot directly change a channel's adstock, adapt your creative strategy to align with its short-term nature. Focus on campaigns that drive immediate action, such as limited-time promotions or direct \"shop now\" calls-to-action.\n2.  **Reallocate Budget for Higher Returns:** Given Pinterest's low efficiency (ROI 1.1, mROI 0.009), consider reallocating its budget to a channel with a higher potential for growth. TikTok currently has a much higher marginal ROI of 0.019, meaning every dollar shifted from Pinterest to TikTok could generate more than double the incremental return at current spending levels.\n\n**Guardrails:**\nThis analysis is based on an observed weekly spend for Pinterest between $10,000 and $40,000. The recommendation for TikTok is based on its observed weekly spend range of $20,000 to $70,000.\n\n**Source:**\nModel version meridian_2025_09_20, analyzing data for 2025-Q2.\n\n**Confidence:**\nHigh (Model R²: 0.84, MAPE: 0.13).",
