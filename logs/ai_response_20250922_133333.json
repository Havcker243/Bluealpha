  "response": "**Answer**\nYou can improve your investments by reallocating funds from channels with low marginal returns, such as Pinterest and Snapchat, to TikTok, which currently offers the best return for each additional dollar spent.\n\n**Explanation**\nYour investment strategy should be guided by Marginal ROI (mROI), which measures the return on your *next* dollar of spend. A higher mROI indicates a better opportunity for growth. Currently, some of your channels are reaching saturation, meaning more spending won't deliver proportional returns.\n\n*   **Top Opportunity:** **TikTok** has the highest mROI at **0.019**. This means for every extra dollar you spend, you are getting the most back compared to any other channel. Its saturation is also relatively low at 65%, indicating there is more room to efficiently scale spend.\n*   **Saturated Performers:** While **Facebook Ads** and **Google Ads** are your strongest channels with the highest overall ROI (1.45 and 1.39 respectively), they are becoming saturated (80% and 78%). Their mROIs of 0.017 and 0.018 are solid, but lower than TikTok's, suggesting the next dollar spent there is slightly less effective.\n*   **Areas for Reduction:** **Pinterest**, **Snapchat**, **Twitter Ads**, and **LinkedIn** have the lowest mROIs. **Pinterest** is the most inefficient for further investment with an mROI of only **0.009**, followed by **Snapchat** at **0.010**. These channels are providing a poor return on incremental spending and their budgets should be reconsidered.\n\n**Recommendations**\n1.  **Increase Spend on TikTok:** Shift budget into TikTok to capitalize on its high mROI of 0.019. It has the most potential for efficient growth.\n2.  **Decrease Spend on Underperformers:** Significantly reduce your investment in **Pinterest** (mROI 0.009) and **Snapchat** (mROI 0.010). The funds from these channels will be more effective elsewhere.\n3.  **Maintain and Monitor Top Channels:** Continue investing in Google Ads and Facebook Ads, but monitor their mROI closely. As they are nearing saturation, future budget increases should be cautious.\n\n**Guardrails**\nThis analysis is based on the observed weekly spend ranges within the model. Performance may differ outside these ranges.\n*   **TikTok:** $20,000 - $70,000\n*   **Pinterest:** $10,000 - $40,000\n*   **Snapchat:** $10,000 - $50,000\n*   **Google Ads:** $60,000 - $120,000\n*   **Facebook Ads:** $70,000 - $150,000\n\n**Source**\nModel Version: meridian_2025_09_20\nData Period: 2025-Q2\n\n**Confidence**\nHigh (The model's R-squared of 0.84 and MAPE of 0.13 indicate a strong and reliable fit to the data.)",
